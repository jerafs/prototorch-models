    "\n",
    "[ProtoTorch](https://github.com/si-cim/prototorch) provides [torch.nn](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) modules and utilities to implement prototype-based models. However, it is up to the user to put these modules together into models and handle the training of these models. Expert machine-learning practioners and researchers sometimes prefer this level of control. However, this leads to a lot of boilerplate code that is essentially same across many projects. Needless to say, this is a source of a lot of frustration. [PyTorch-Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a framework that helps avoid a lot of this frustration by handling the boilerplate code for you so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you need to implement a new model.\n",

    "With the [prototorch.models](https://github.com/si-cim/prototorch_models) plugin, we've gone one step further and pre-packaged commonly used prototype-models like GMLVQ as [Lightning-Modules](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pytorch_lightning.core.lightning.html?highlight=lightning%20module#pytorch_lightning.core.lightning.LightningModule). With only a few lines to code, it is now possible to build and train prototype-models. It quite simply cannot get any simpler than this."

    "The key `distribution` in the `hparams` argument describes the prototype distribution. If it is a Python [list](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html), it is assumed that there are as many entries in this list as there are classes, and the number at each location of this list describes the number of prototypes to be used for that particular class. So, `[1, 1, 1]` implies that we have three classes with one prototype per class.   If it is a Python [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html), a shorthand of `(num_classes, prototypes_per_class)` is assumed. If it is a Python [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html), the key-value pairs describe the class label and the number of prototypes for that class respectively. So, `{0: 2, 1: 2, 2: 2}` implies that we have three classes with labels `{1, 2, 3}`, each equipped with two prototypes. If however, the dictionary contains the keys `\"num_classes\"` and `\"per_class\"`, they are parsed to use their values as one might expect.\n",

This argument has to be an instantiated object of some kind of [AbstractComponentsInitializer](https://github.com/si-cim/prototorch/blob/dev/prototorch/components/initializers.py#L18). If this is a [ShapeAwareCompInitializer](https://github.com/si-cim/prototorch/blob/dev/prototorch/components/initializers.py#L41), this only requires a `shape` arugment that describes the shape of the prototypes. So, `pt.initializers.ZerosCompInitializer(3)` creates 3d-vector prototypes all initialized to zeros."
