About
-----------------------------------------
`Prototorch Models <https://github.com/si-cim/prototorch_models>`_ is a Plugin
for `Prototorch <https://github.com/si-cim/prototorch>`_. It implements common
prototype-based Machine Learning algorithms using `PyTorch-Lightning
<https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/>`_.

Library
-----------------------------------------
Prototorch Models delivers many application ready models.
These models have been published in the past and have been adapted to the
Prototorch library.

Customizable
-----------------------------------------
Prototorch Models also contains the building blocks to build own models with
PyTorch-Lightning and Prototorch.
